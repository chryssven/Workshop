</div>
<p>I'm Chryss Ven James Albores and was born on a cold winter night, when even time seemed to stand still, in Cebu City St. Vincent hospital. I do not remember much of my early childhood, 
but my mom said that I was a very active, curious, and communicative child. I would ask dozens of questions each minute, even without waiting for the answers. 
I suppose this is why my parents offered me books and educational movies as early as my third birthday.</p>

<p>Fortunately, my thirst for knowledge did not come to an end when I was at school. I was passionate about computer. This passion helped me gain profound 
knowledge in these areas, and I was admitted to the college of my dreams. Today, I am a student at College Of Technological University, and I feel very happy about it.</p>

</div>
<p>I am certain that my degree will become my ticket to a better tomorrow. I want to become an An IT Specialist, computer professional, or an IT professional may be a person 
working in the field of information technology. I study hard and devote my free time to reading scholarly reviews and watching interviews with recognized specialists in the field.</p>

</div>
<p>Of course, I understand that life is not just a bed of roses, and challenges and hardships are an integral element of life. Since my parents could not help me cover
my college expenses in full, paying off my student loan has become an important challenge for me. I combine a part-time job and full-time study to earn my living and 
my education. I feel triumphant at the beginning of every month when I receive my salary and plan how I will spend my money.</p>
